# Numerical_Simulations-outputs
Original outputs files from CII (Collisional Interchange Instability) numerical model.

ABOUT SIMULATION DATA:

Numerical experiments I, II, and III data are provided through the files NE1.out, NE2.out, NE3.out, respectively.
The electrostatic potential(phi) presented in Figure 8 is given through the file NE3_POT.out.
The procedure to all these files is simply to reshape the format 5673x62 to (61x93x62).

This last reshaped files will correspond to (Ne (time), Ne(longitude), Ne(height)) in the case of NE1.out, NE2.out, NE3.out, respectively and (phi(time), phi(longitude), phi(height)) in the case of electrostatic potential.

The file TIME_debug.out is an alternative file to exhibit the time for each output.
